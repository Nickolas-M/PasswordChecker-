# Password Strength Checker

This program checks the strength of a password. There are 6 different criterias that the program checks for.

  1) Length of password - (Password must be at least 14 characters).
  2) Checks if the password contains at least one upper case letter.
  3) Checks if the password contains at least one lower case letter.
  4) Checks if the password contains at least one number.
  5) Checks if the password contains any special characters.
  6) Checks if the password is within the supplied wordlist.

Feel free to change the wordlist in the program to a more relevant one especially as the passwords contained in the provided wordlist are rudimentary. I hope everyone enjoys this program and can find it useful.
